My first added comment on a pulled project!





education
=========

A small repository for education purposes. Please do not flood it with unuseful info at toplevel!

It mostly contains random content for Git and GitHub education.

To all `students`: 
Let's create something unique here. A repository that contains hints 
about the perfect education.
Let's say one file for each:
* perfect video-conference evening in Moodle
* perfect documentation
* perfect add-on material
* perfect feedback
* perfect moodle
+ ...?

Happy to receive your pull requests!
